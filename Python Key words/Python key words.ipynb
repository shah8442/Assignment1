    "Que: Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    " \n",
    " -> Rules must be followed when writing a Python identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Keywords cannot be used as identifier names as they are reserved words in Python programming language. If you try, it will throw Syntax Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Python identifiers can contain letters in a small case (a-z), upper case (A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscore (_).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Identifiers cannot begin with a digit. For example, 10test would be an invalid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Python identifiers can’t contain only digits. For example, 888 would be an invalid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Python identifier names can start with an underscore. So, the _test would be a valid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) There is no limit on the length of the identifier name. \n",
    "\n",
    "7) Python identifier names are case-sensitive. So, “abc” and “ABC” are two different identifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "ab10c:  Contains only letters and numbers\n",
    "abc_DE: Valid identifier\n",
    "_:  an  underscore is a valid identifier\n",
    "_abc:   Valid identifier\n",
    "char2 : valid identifier\n",
    "char_1 : valid indetifier"

    "Without proper indentation in Python code, you will end up getting an Indentation Error and the code will not get compiled. Python is an interpreted language, its interpreter reads the code line by line. In Python, we have to write code that is appropriately formatted with perfect use of gaps to make the code error free.
